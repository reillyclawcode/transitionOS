# TransitionOS

Interactive workforce transition dashboard and simulation engine. Explore career transitions across 20 occupations, reskilling paths ranked by ROI, income bridge calculations powered by Civic Dividends, and 10-year cohort projections across three policy scenarios.

Built as the operational layer described in the [AI Civilization Research Paper](https://reillyclawcode.github.io/clawcodeblog/research/ai-civilization/) — the "career GPS plus payments engine" that keeps workers afloat through automation shocks.

## What it does

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Overview** | Key workforce metrics at a glance — workers covered, at-risk count, average automation risk, and a 2035 scenario comparison with poverty rate trajectory chart |
| **Occupation Explorer** | Browse 20 occupations (7 at-risk, 3 transitioning, 10 growth-sector) with automation risk bars, salary, growth outlook, and category filters |
| **Path Planner** | Select a source occupation from a grouped dropdown and see ranked reskilling routes with salary comparison chart, training cost, duration, success rate, credential, and composite ROI score |
| **Income Bridge** | See how Civic Dividends + unemployment benefits cover the income gap during reskilling — with 10-year net gain projections |
| **Cohort Projections** | 10-year KPI trajectories (poverty, reskill time, placement, liquidity, employment, emissions, charter audits) across three scenarios with interactive year scrubber |
| **Implementation Phases** | Seven-phase roadmap from discovery sprint to global export, with funding stack breakdown |

## Stack

### Dashboard (Next.js)
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 3 with glassmorphism dark theme
- Recharts for interactive charts (area, bar, comparison)
- Static seed data (generated by Python engine)

### API (FastAPI)
- FastAPI + Pydantic + Uvicorn
- Skills graph engine with 20 occupations, 31 skills, 60+ transition paths
- ROI-ranked path planner with composite scoring
- Income gap calculator with Civic Dividend bridge modelling
- 10-year cohort simulation with stochastic elements across 3 scenarios

## Quick start

### Dashboard only (no API needed)

```bash
cd apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

The dashboard reads from `public/data/seed.json` which is pre-generated.

### Full stack (API + Dashboard)

```bash
# Terminal 1: API
cd apps/api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Dashboard
cd apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up
# Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
# API:       http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Regenerate seed data

```bash
cd apps/api
python -m engine.generate
# Outputs to apps/dashboard/public/data/seed.json
```

## Data model

### Occupations (20 total)

**At-Risk** (automation risk > 60%): Truck Driver, Retail Cashier, Data Entry Clerk, Assembly Line Worker, Telemarketer, Bookkeeper, Fast Food Cook

**Transitioning** (30–60%): Customer Service Rep, Administrative Assistant, Warehouse Worker

**Growth** (< 30%): Solar Panel Installer, Wind Turbine Technician, Cybersecurity Analyst, Data Analyst, UX Designer, Healthcare Technician, Building Retrofit Specialist, EV Technician, Community Health Worker, Logistics Coordinator

### Skills (31 skills across 6 categories)

Physical, Technical, Digital, Communication, Analytical, Green — each with a transferability score indicating how broadly useful it is across occupations.

### Transition paths (60+ paths)

Each path includes shared skills, new skills needed, training months, cost, success rate, and the credential earned. Paths are ranked by a composite ROI score blending salary uplift, success rate, speed, and automation risk reduction.

### Cohort simulation (3 scenarios × 10 years)

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Baseline** | No intervention — secular trends, automation pressure, slow climate progress |
| **Transition OS** | Reskilling platform deployed — accelerated placement, reduced reskill time, modest stipends |
| **Full Stack** | Transition OS + Civic Dividends + VPP pilots — fastest poverty reduction, best household liquidity |

Eight metrics tracked: poverty rate, median reskill time, placement rate, stipend utilization, household liquidity, employment rate, emissions intensity, charter audit coverage.

## Design system

The dashboard uses a dark glassmorphism theme matching the [Simulation Toolkit](https://github.com/reillyclawcode/simulation):

- **Background**: Deep navy (#030712) with ambient radial glows
- **Cards**: Semi-transparent with backdrop blur and subtle borders
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk (headings) + Inter (body)
- **Palette**: Sky (#38bdf8), Emerald (#34d399), Violet (#8b5cf6), Amber (#f59e0b), Rose (#f43f5e)
- **Charts**: Recharts with gradient fills and scenario-coloured lines
